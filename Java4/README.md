# Homework 4

Make a GUI verion of the guessing game.

The application must:
    * Notify the user the range that the number is in, for example 1 - 16.
    * Notify the user how many guesses they have remaining.
    * Provide the user with a **graphical** way of entering the guesses.

A graphical way of entering the guesses includes buttons in a layout similar to a calculator or phone, a slider, spinner, or some other method of entry.  A textbox is not acceptable.  Here are some links to the API documentation for some useful components:

* [Button](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JButton.html)
* [Slider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JSlider.html)
* [Spinner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JSpinner.html)

And of course [chapter 16](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001805/ch16.html) in the textbook will be very useful as well.
